# FlowDoc Specification (v1)

This document describes FlowDoc v1 specification. FlowDoc is a minimal, human-friendly alternative to JSON/YAML/XML designed for configuration files, app settings, templates, data exchange, offline storage, CLI tools and embedded scripts.

Key properties:
- Clean syntax
- Very small file size
- Easy to parse
- 1:1 conversion to JSON
- Binary version (.flowb) uses MessagePack

See `SYNTAX.md` for syntax examples and `PARSING_RULES.md` for the parser algorithm.
